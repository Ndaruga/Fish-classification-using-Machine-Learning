# Fish-classification-using-Machine-Learning
### A deep learning project using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to classify fish species

The project contains an image augmentor file which will augment the provided images to a certain number. 
Augmentor file uses the augmentor library that we could use to transform and regenerate images by applying transformations such as rotation, shearing, mirroring etc.
Augmentation on images has been done for two reasons.
<ul>
<li>To increase number of images per fish category</li>
<li>To train the model recognize a species fom different perspectives</li>
</ul>
